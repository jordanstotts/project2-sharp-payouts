# project2-sharp-payouts

## Project Description

My app is called Sharp Payouts.  It is a sports betting app that will show users the current odds for any specific game being played that day across the four major American sports leagues (NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL). Users will be able to click on a link of the sport they are interested in and it will take them to the games for that day. If time allows Iâ€™d like to add a feature that shows the odds from multiple different sportsbooks to give the users an option on where they would like to place their bets.
